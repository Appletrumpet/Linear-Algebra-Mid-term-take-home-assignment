Structure of the first exercise:

own_and_numpy_matrix_multiplication.py:
Contains the exercises 1.a and 1.c, where we should implement the standard matrix multiplication
and compare it's runtime to the dot() function of NumPy.

strassens_algorithm.py:
Contains the exercise 1.e, where we should implement 2 versions of the strassen's algorithm for 
2x2 matrices, one with and one without recursion and further compare it's runtime again to the 
standard matrix multiplication and NumPy. 

Note: I'm aware that only comparing dimension 2 matrix multiplications in Exercise 1.e might seem 
odd, especially because the use of recursion in this context only makes sense for matrices of a 
much larger dimension, but this was clearly stated in the assignment!!!

The rest of the exercises can be found on my solution sheets.
