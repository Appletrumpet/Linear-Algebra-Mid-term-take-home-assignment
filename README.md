...py contains the exercises 1.a and 1.c, where we should implement the standard matrix multiplication
and compare it's runtime to the dot() function of NumPy.
...py contains the exercise 1.e, where we should implement 2 versions of the strassen's algorithm, one
without and one with recursion and further compare it's runtime again to the standard matrix 
multiplication and NumPy.
